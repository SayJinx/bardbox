Bard Box was my capstone project for front end web design with Launch Code's CoderGirl (now called Woman+) program. It pulls and plays YouTube video playlists from a pre-selected list, organized by what game you're playing and what mood you're trying to evoke. Bard Box was designed with tabletop roleplaying in mind, especially moving forward after 2020 when so many games have moved online. With the YouTube API you can click Playlists to see the contents of each.

The player has loaded its game and mood and the playlist autoplays.
